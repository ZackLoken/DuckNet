# DuckNet

*DuckNet* is an open-source, deep learning-based tool for rapidly and accurately detecting, localizing, and classifying species of waterfowl in drone imagesâ€”forked from the amazing work of [BatNet](https://github.com/GabiK-bat/BatNet). The baseline model (SSD with VGG16 backbone) is trained to identify seven waterfowl species and one species of other waterbird: American coot (*Fulica americana*), gadwall (*Mareca strepera*), green-winged teal (*Anas carolinensis*), northern pintail (*Anas acuta*), northern shoveler (*Spatula clypeata*), mallard (*Anas platyrhynchos*), redhead (*Aythya americana*), and ring-necked duck (*Aythya collaris*).
